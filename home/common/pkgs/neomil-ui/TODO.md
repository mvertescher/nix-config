- [x] create scripts/download_images.py to download all the neomil related images from:
  - https://www.behance.net/gallery/118663901/Cyberpunk-2077User-Interface-(Part-1)
  - https://www.behance.net/gallery/133185623/Cyberpunk-2077User-Interface-(Part-2)
- [x] define main colors.rs:
  - primary red #FF3B45
  - primary black #DEDE17
  - also need to set opacities properly
- [x] create iced advanced container. "chip type 1"
- [ ] Reproduce dashboard image (`img-07-dashboard.png`) in demo app:
  - [ ] Implement custom background (gradient/glow)
  - [ ] Implement `InfoPanel` widget (chamfered top-right/bottom-left)
  - [ ] Implement `DiamondMenu` widget (interlocking interactive diamonds)
  - [ ] Update demo app layout, colors, and text to match image

## Toolkit infrastructure

- [ ] **Visual regression as a nix checkPhase**: headless-compositor
  screenshot + pixel diff against reference images is genuinely mature
  practice for a UI toolkit — most hobby toolkits have nothing. But
  it's currently desktop-coupled shell scripts (hyprctl resolution
  detection), and the grim capture doesn't work against current Weston
  (evaluation on 2026-08-21 had to use weston-screenshooter; the
  script's --debug flag suggests that was the original path too, so
  the grim step may have always been broken). The high-leverage move:
  fold it into the derivation as a nix checkPhase — weston headless +
  pixman renderer + weston-screenshooter + visual_diff.py runs fine on
  a headless box (proved on the server: needs a software Vulkan ICD
  for the app, e.g. VK_ICD_FILENAMES=<mesa>/share/vulkan/icd.d/
  lvp_icd.x86_64.json, since iced panics rather than falling back
  when wgpu finds no adapter) — which would make every build a visual
  regression test, CI-able the day this becomes its own repo.
